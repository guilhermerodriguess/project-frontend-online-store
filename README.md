# Front-end Online Store

Hello! Welcome to my Front-end Online Store project repository! In this project, I created a simplified version of an online store, developing its functionalities according to the demands defined in a Kanban board. This is an experience close to the labor market scenario.

From the demands, we developed an application in which users can search for products by terms and categories using the Mercado Livre API. In addition, users can interact with products by adding and removing them from the shopping cart, viewing product details and reviews, and simulating checkout.

## Features Developed

- MercadoLibre API Access Module: I implemented a module that performs access to MercadoLibre's API.
- Empty Product Listing Page: I created a home page that displays the empty product listing, with a search field.
- Shopping Cart Page: I developed a page to represent the shopping cart, where products can be added and removed.
- Category List: On the main page, I added a list of categories to filter the search by category.
- Listing of Products by Terms: I implemented the functionality to search and display products according to the terms entered by the user.
- Listing of Products by Category: I added the functionality to list the products of a certain category.
- Product Details Page: When clicking on a product, I redirected the user to a page that displays the product details.
- Add Products to Cart: Implemented the functionality to add products to the cart from the product listing page.
- Add Products to Cart from Details: On the product details page, I added the functionality to add the product to cart.
- List of Products in the Cart: Display all products added to the cart on the shopping cart page.
- Manipulation of the Quantity of Products in the Cart: In the shopping cart, allow the user to increase and/or decrease the quantity of each product.
- Product Rating and Review: On the product detail page, I added a form to rate and comment on the product.
- Checkout: I created a page to check out, where the user can add their information and choose the payment method.
- Quantity of Products in the Cart Icon: I added the display of the quantity of products in the cart icon on all screens where it appears.
- Quantity Limit of Products in the Cart: I set a maximum limit for the quantity of products that can be added to the cart according to stock availability.
- Free Shipping Indication: Added free shipping information on products that have this condition.

## Technologies Used

## Bonus requirements

In addition to the mandatory requirements, I also implemented some bonus requirements:

- Custom Layout: I added a nice layout to the application to provide a good user experience.
- Responsive Layout: I created a complete responsive layout, adapting the application to different screen sizes.
- Sorting Products by Price: I implemented a dropdown selector that allows sorting the list of products by highest and lowest price.
- Cart animation: Added an animation to the shopping cart when a product is added or removed.
- Cart Side Slider: I created a side slider to display the cart on the main screen, allowing it to be displayed and hidden with the interaction of a button.
- Highlight of Products in the Cart: I highlighted the products added to the cart, differentiating them from the other products on the main page.
